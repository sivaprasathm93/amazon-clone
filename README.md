# amazon-clone

This Amazon clone project is built using React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS for the frontend. 
It incorporates React Router for navigation, lucide-react for icons, and Swiper for product sliders. 
The application uses a context API with CartContext to manage the shopping cart state. Styling is enhanced with custom SCSS modules. 
The backend is simulated with local data files. Vite is used as the build tool.
